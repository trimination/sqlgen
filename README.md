CREATE table SQL tool.

I often plan quick project db's with text like

`field1, field2, field3, field4, field5, field6`

etc, and figured it would be great to easily convert that into
a CREATE statement.

So this html/JS does that; it's rudimentary and maybe prone to 
breaking, but maybe someone will find it useful.

P.S. The JS is a mess :D
